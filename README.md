## Description

This is an invoice PDF generator built with NestJS. The application allows users to generate a PDF invoice by simply entering an invoice number. The PDF includes a professional layout with company information, client details, and an itemized table.

## Features

- Generate PDF invoices with custom invoice numbers
- Professional invoice layout with company and client details
- Itemized table with product/service information
- Standalone mode that doesn't require a running server
- Command-line interface for generating invoices

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Generate PDF Invoice

### Using the CLI Script (Recommended)

The simplest way to generate a PDF invoice is using the command-line script:

1. Compile the TypeScript file first:
```bash
$ npx tsc src/generate-pdf.ts --outDir dist
```

2. Run the script with an invoice number:
```bash
$ node dist/generate-pdf.js 12345
```

This will generate a PDF file at `uploads/invoice-12345.pdf`.

### Using the Web Interface

```bash
# Start the standalone interface
$ node open-standalone.js
```

This opens a simple HTML interface where you can enter an invoice number, which will then provide instructions for generating the PDF.

### Using the Full Web Application

```bash
# Start in development mode
$ npm run start:dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to use the web interface.

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
